	I am a student of Conestoga College where I am studying Computer Science. This website is a personal project I started with the intention to create a form of personal branding to showcase my past projects or other information about myself.

	<h1>Personal Information</h1>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
		<li>Name: Rian Sanchez</li>
		<li>Education: 
			<ul>
				<li>Bachelor of Computer Science (2022 - Present)</li>
				<li>Specialist High Skills Major (2021)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Hobbies: 
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Video Games</strong><br>
					Video games is one of my biggest past time hobbies, they've been a large part of my life and have heavily influenced my love and interest in computers and technology.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Reading</strong><br>
					The other biggest hobby of mine is reading. I love the feeling of exploring a world that exists in the imagination. Reading about imagined worlds and experiencing the connections between characters is always intriguing and enjoyable to me. I especially love start-up Eastern Novels, they're called "Webnovels" and are books written by avid enthusiasts who have no funding. It's nature as more underground and experimental books means I find a lot of stories with subversive and niche plots or ideas.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Interests: 
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Video Game Dissection</strong><br>
					As I've become more involved in the behind the scenes of coding and hardware, my love for video games has evolved from enjoying them to enjoying dissecting them and figuring out how they crafted such amazing experiences. One day I hope to be able to create a video game that people will enjoy playing.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Story Telling</strong><br>
					It's through my love of reading I've developed my analyzing and also learned about the importance of pacing and providing information to the readers. After reading so many stories and playing video games with immersive stories I've wanted to create a story or world of my own and hopefully feature it in a video game of my own creation.
